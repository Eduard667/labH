# Explaining PersonNode

**AddressBookSLL** is a friend class of **PersonNode** class. 
  So that it can access private members. 

  Added Getters - getName() and setAge() - made them const (they do not modify the values)
  Added Setters - setName() and setAge()

# Explaining AddressBookSLL

This class initiates more functionality than **PersonNode** class. 
It defines: 
  - AddPerson() - Updates pointers, adds new node. 
  - FindPerson() - which is of type PersonNode*. 
  - DeletePerson() - boolean return type, updates pointers, removes users from address book
  - Print() (to ostream)

This declares that **m_head** is the end of the linked list

Methods for AddPerson & FindPerson

### How AddPerson() works
We create a new instance of PersonNode (new element / person to add in the list).
If the list is empty, then m_head points to the newNode. 
If the list is not empty, We traverse to the element which has a **nullptr**, add element, update the pointers. 

### How FindPerson() works
Gets current node (m_head)
if list is not empty, return the current node
else return nullptr (list is empty.

Method to delete a person. 
This method uses previous and current pointers and updates them. It also check whether we are at the first node, node in between first and last.
